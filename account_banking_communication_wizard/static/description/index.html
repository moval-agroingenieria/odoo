    <p>
        This module allows to edit, individually or massively, the communication field used in the payment /debit orders.<br>
        <br>
        For bulk editing there are 3 jinja2 variables available (payment_order, payment_line and invoice, see screenshot above).<br>
        <br>
        Note that this field is sent by the bank to the end customer so it can be used to transmit information about the payment
        order / debit to the end customer.<br>
        <br>
        This field is limited to 140 characters after resolving variables.
